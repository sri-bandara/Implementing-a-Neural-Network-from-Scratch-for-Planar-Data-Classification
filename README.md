# Implementing-a-Neural-Network-from-Scratch-for-Planar-Data-Classification

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Context</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> This repository illustrates a neural network built from scratch using numpy for planar data classification. The objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks and to familiarise myself with forward prop, backward prop and all the intricate functions of a neural network. </p>

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Dataset</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> This dataset was extracted from an exercise available in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization. The specialization is offered by Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI through Coursera. </p>

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Process</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> A neural network with two layers was designed for this task. The hidden layer contained 2 units with tanh activation, followed by the output layer which had 1 unit with a sigmoid activation. A vectoised version of the logistic loss function was used for cost calculation. The model was trained and optimized with gradient descent. </p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #333333;"> The dataset and much of the inspiration for the implementation of the neural network comes from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning" target="_blank" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;">Deep Learning Specialization</a>. This project is based on the teachings and exercises from the specialization’s first course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning" target="_blank" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;"> Neural Networks and Deep Learning </a>.
  
Special thanks to Andrew Ng for providing a clear and accessible introduction to core deep learning concepts.
